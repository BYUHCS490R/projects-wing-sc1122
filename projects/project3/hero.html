He is the one bring me into this trend. There are six members in TWS, but why he is my bais and hero? <span class="smile">Because of his smile!</span> His smile is infectious, I can say whoever see him smile, you smile together uncontrollably. His smile like a eraser which can wipe away all the negative emotions. </p>
