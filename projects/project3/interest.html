        <h2>My Interest - Kpop Idols:TWS</h2>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
        They were debuted on 22 January 2024, and they have comeback three times before. They are going to have a comeback stage very soon on October. Starting from their first debut, they keep having a youthful campus style, which have attract many fans.
        </p>
        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>Their most popular song is 'Plot Twist', which has reached 43 million views on the offical music video. And my favourite in recent is 'Nice to see you again'. Both of the songs are youful and the choreography are so vibrant that can heal my stress every time I listen or watch it.</p>
        <h4>Programme</h4>
        <p>They will upload some videos frequently, like dance challenges with other Kpop group, Vlog, and their own programme - TWS Club. They will play different games in the show or hangout eating food together. I like watch their interaction with each other and their facial expression during the games. When I watch it, I can forget about school and work and relax my mind.</p>
