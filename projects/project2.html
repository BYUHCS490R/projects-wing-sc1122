    <h1>&lt;Steffi Cheung&gt;</h1>
    <p>Morning, my name is <em>Steffi</em> from Hong Kong. I am studying in BYUH majoring in Information Technology, minoring Accounting and Japanese. There are four members in my family, my mother, father, and a older brother. My favourite sport is rope skipping. I have joined the rope skipping team and represent my school participated many competition and won couple medal.</p>
    <p>I am a kpop fan, I listen to different groups. And my favourite group is <strong>TWS</strong>. They are under the same company of SEVENTEEN, PLEDIS. There are six members in this group. Five of them are from Korea and  one from China. My favourite member is Jihoon, he is the second young in the group. I like him because of the way he dance. He really good at tutting, but he did not learn from a professional teacher, he learn it by himself and he can do it so good. 
    </p>
