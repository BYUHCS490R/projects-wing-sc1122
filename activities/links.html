        <p>2. root is the landing page, the first page of the web, without a path. when we open different pages in our web, the link will show the path which where the page save at.</p>
        <p>3. defalt document is a page called index that will be shown automatically when people open the link that without path, it is a designed page instead of a list of files</p>
        <p>4. absolute link is the full link which we can see on the top of the broswer that we can use it to link to an outside website. relative link is links that link to other files that in the same folder, so we can just type in the file name of it.</p>

                <li>files should be in the same folder</li>
                <li>if the files is in the subfolder, we have to include the subfolder name in front of the file name</li>
                <li>if the file is in a parent folder, we have to use ../ to move up one level </li>
            </ul>
