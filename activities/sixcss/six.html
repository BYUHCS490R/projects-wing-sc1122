        <p>1. Normal flow is the webpage without any positioning and floating applied.</p>
        <p>2. float is to move a tag to left or right, then other content tags will wrap arounf it. we clear the float for the content that we dont want to warp around the floated element like footer.</p>
        <p>3. relative: original spot, no change. absolute: we can control the position by inputting the top, left, or margin pixel. fixeed: stay in the same position when we scroll.</p>
        <p>4. we can use display :block to enlarge the area that mobile device user can access the link easily.</p>
        <p>5. it is in the modules, then find the corresponding topic week. the video is included in the the lecture notes.</p>
